# React Intensive 3-Week Bootcamp

This is my personal learning repository, where I document my daily progress as I prepare for my upcoming internship as a **Full-Stack Developer**. My main goal is to build a strong foundation in **JavaScript** and **React**, especially since my internship stack includes **React and Vue**, and I have limited experience with JavaScript.

This roadmap was created in collaboration with ChatGPT, and what makes it especially interesting for me is that it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôm learning a technology **fully guided by AI instead of a real person**.

## About Me

I'm a 19-year-old Software Development student (MBO 4, Year 2) based in the Netherlands.  
My background includes experience with **Python**, **PHP**, and **Laravel**, but I‚Äôm new to frontend frameworks like React.

This repository is part of my **self-structured learning system** to document, track, and solidify my skills through theory, practice, and mini-projects.
